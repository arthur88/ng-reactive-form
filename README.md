## Tutorial explain

Reactive forms provide the model-driven approach to handle the form inputs whose values are changing over time. Reactive forms use the specific and immutable approach to managing the state of the form at the given point of time. Each change to the form state returns the new state, which maintains the integrity of a model between the changes. Reactive forms also provide the straightforward path to testing because you are assured that your data is consistent and predictable when the request has been made. by https://appdividend.com/2018/10/24/angular-7-forms-tutorial-example/
